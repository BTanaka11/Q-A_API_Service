# Q&A API Service
This project is a back-end follow-up to the L77 Online Clothing Store project in which a front-end web app was built using an external API for its data needs. Of the front-end web app's 4 pages (Product Information, Related Products, Q&A, and Ratings/Reviews), I took Q&A and built an API service for it from scratch. My API service is interchangable on the front-end with the previous external API.
